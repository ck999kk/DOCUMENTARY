
Move-Out Guide
Moving can be a mixture of emotions: excitement for the next chapter, nostalgia for the memories you're leaving behind, and the natural stress that comes with change. However, with proper planning and organization, the process can be streamlined and less overwhelming. This guide aims to provide you with step-by-step instructions to ensure that your move-out goes as smoothly as possible.
Booking Your Move-Out
For those 
vacating
 a development, it's 
a requirement
 to schedule your move-out date and time with the building manager promptly.
Many developments 
require 
move-out pre-bookings to facilitate lift protection and assign a designated lift. Without this pre-booking, you might encounter disruptions due to other residents' reservations.
Tips for a Prompt Bond Return
Power Connection:
Â We recommend keeping the power connected for three business days after you return your keys. This will allow the final inspection to be completed with the power on. If the power is disconnected, we will need to establish a new connection, which may delay the bond return.
Professional Cleaning:
Cleaning a property can be more time-consuming than expected. For peace of mind and thoroughness, consider hiring a professional cleaning service. Please refer to the end-of-lease cleaning checklist.
We recommend the following two cleaning services, both of which have consistently delivered exceptional results for our renters.

 If there's any accidental damage, ensure it's addressed before returning the keys. Only use qualified tradespeople for repairs to guarantee quality. Should DIY repairs not meet expected standards, it might lead to bond deductions.

 If applicable, ensure your storage cage is emptied, cleaned, and

s removed.
Car space:
 If your car has
 had an oil
 leak, ensure you have the oil stain removed. Please make sure the car space is clean with no belongings or rubbish left behind.
Keys &amp; Remotes:
 Return all items provided at the beginning of your tenancy
 to the office
. If anything
 is missing
, notify your property manager 
as soon as possible
 so they can arrange a replacement. 
Rubbish:
 Do not leave 
rubbish
 inside or around the property. Any violation of the ownerâ€™s corporation rules, such as unauthorized disposal, could lead to additional fees.
Personal Items:
Double-check
 every area, including drawers and cupboards, to ensure no personal items get left behind.
Handy Tips
Wall Marks:
 A 'Chux Magic Eraser', which is available at outlets like Coles or Woolworths, is ideal for mark removal. Always adhere to its usage instructions for optimal results.
Light Globes:
 Make sure to replace non-functional globes throughout the premises. If overlooked, there might be
 electrician
 charges for replacements.
