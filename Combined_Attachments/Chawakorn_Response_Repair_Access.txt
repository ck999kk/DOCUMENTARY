Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.
Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
