# QUICK START


To analyze and cite evidence from this repository for government or legal submission:

1. Read the README.md for case context and repository structure.
2. Use OCR text files for analysis:
	- Combined_Attachments/*.txt
	- Additional_Documents/**/*.txt
	- All_Case_Parties_EML/*.eml
3. For every citation, reference the original evidence file (.pdf, .jpg, .png, .eml) using a permanent GitHub URL (commit-specific).
4. Include the first 16 characters of the SHA256 hash from `VERIFICATION/integrity_manifest.sha256` for each cited file.
5. Reference the chain of custody in `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY.md`.
6. Ensure all generated documents include:
	- Case Reference: R202518214 and/or R202518589
	- Repository Citation: <https://github.com/ck999kk/DOCUMENTARY>
	- SHA256 Hash Verification
	- Chain of Custody Reference


## MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS

1. Always verify the SHA256 hash for every cited evidence file. Use the hash from `VERIFICATION/integrity_manifest.sha256`.
2. Use only permanent GitHub URLs (with commit hash) for citations, not branch URLs.
3. Cross-reference the Evidence Index (`LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`) to ensure correct mapping between OCR and original files.
4. Reference the chain of custody for every citation.


## TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQ


**Q: What if the SHA256 hash is missing for a file?**
A: Update `VERIFICATION/integrity_manifest.sha256` to include the missing file and its hash.

**Q: What if the citation format is incorrect?**
A: Use the following format:

```text
Source: [Document Name]
URL: <https://github.com/ck999kk/DOCUMENTARY/blob/[commit]/path/to/file.pdf>
Hash: [First 16 characters of SHA256]
Verified: [Date] per Chain of Custody
```

**Q: What if chain of custody is not referenced?**
A: Add a reference to `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY.md` in your document.

**Q: How do I generate permanent GitHub URLs?**
A: Use the commit hash in the URL, e.g., <https://github.com/ck999kk/DOCUMENTARY/blob/[commit]/path/to/file.pdf>

**Q: Who to contact for support?**
A: Contact the repository owner or refer to the README.md for support information.
