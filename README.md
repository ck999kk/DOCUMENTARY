## üì¶ Quick Start

- **For AI:** Use `.txt` OCR files for analysis.
- **For Legal:** Cite original files with commit-pinned GitHub URLs and SHA256 hashes.
- **For Everyone:** See `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` for file relationships.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/` ‚Äì Chain of custody, evidence index, exhibits
- `VERIFICATION/` ‚Äì SHA256 manifest for integrity checks
- `All_Case_Parties_EML/` ‚Äì Email evidence
- `Combined_Attachments/` ‚Äì Attachments + OCR text
- `Additional_Documents/` ‚Äì Extra evidence, financial, supporting docs
- `tools/` ‚Äì Scripts for citation and table generation

---

## üîí Integrity Check

Run from the repository root to verify against the manifest:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
shasum -a 256 -c VERIFICATION/integrity_manifest.sha256
```

Notes:
- The manifest intentionally excludes itself and volatile files (e.g., `.DS_Store`).
- If files change, regenerate the manifest from repo root:
  `find . -type f -not -name '.DS_Store' -not -path './.git/*' -not -path './.venv/*' -not -path './VERIFICATION/integrity_manifest.sha256' -print0 | xargs -0 shasum -a 256 > VERIFICATION/integrity_manifest.sha256`

---

## üìù Citation Example

```
Source: [Document Name]
URL: https://github.com/ck999kk/DOCUMENTARY/blob/[commit]/path/to/file.pdf
Hash: [First 16 characters of SHA256]
Verified: [Date] per Chain of Custody
```

---

## ü§ñ AI Usage

- Use OCR `.txt` files for analysis/search
- Reference original files for citations
- Always include SHA256 hash and chain of custody

---

## ü§ñ For AI Agents

- Start here: `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` (maps originals ‚Üî OCR text with SHA256).
- Exhibits: `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/EXHIBITS_commit_pinned.md` and `.csv` (commit‚Äëpinned URLs + hashes).
- Chain of Custody: `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY.md` (handling timeline and verification notes).
- Integrity: `VERIFICATION/integrity_manifest.sha256` and quick check via `tools/verify.sh check`.
- Citations: `LEGAL_DOCUMENTATION/CITATIONS.md` (ready‚Äëto‚Äëcopy citation blocks).

Notes for agents:
- Do not alter originals; derivatives live alongside and are referenced in legal docs.
- When new evidence is added, regenerate manifest with `tools/verify.sh update` and update Exhibits.

## üìã Evidence Types
